Eureka client tries to retrieve only delta changes from eureka server to minimize network traffic. After receiving the deltas, eureka client reconciles the information from the server to verify it has not missed out some information. Reconciliation failures could happen when the client has had network issues communicating to server.If the reconciliation fails, eureka client gets the full registry information. While getting the full registry information, the eureka client can log the differences between the client and the server and this setting controls that.

Example: https://ec2-256-156-243-129.compute-1.amazonaws.com:7001/eureka/ The changes are effective at runtime at the next service url refresh cycle as specified by eurekaServiceUrlPollIntervalSeconds.

|eureka.client.use-dns-for-fetching-service-urls | false | Indicates whether the eureka client should use the DNS mechanism to fetch a list of eureka servers to talk to. When the DNS name is updated to have additional servers, that information is used immediately after the eureka client polls for that information as specified in eurekaServiceUrlPollIntervalSeconds. Alternatively, the service urls can be returned serviceUrls, but the users should implement their own mechanism to return the updated list in case of changes. The changes are effective at runtime.

|spring.sleuth.keys.async.thread-name-key | thread | Name of the thread that executed the async method @see org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Async

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.headers |  | Additional headers that should be added as tags if they exist. If the header value is multi-valued, the tag value will be a comma-separated, single-quoted list.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.host | http.host | The domain portion of the URL or host header. Example: "mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com". Used to filter by host as opposed to ip address.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.method | http.method | The HTTP method, or verb, such as "GET" or "POST". Used to filter against an http route.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.path | http.path | The absolute http path, without any query parameters. Example: "/objects/abcd-ff". Used to filter against an http route, portably with zipkin v1. In zipkin v1, only equals filters are supported. Dropping query parameters makes the number of distinct URIs less. For example, one can query for the same resource, regardless of signing parameters encoded in the query line. This does not reduce cardinality to a HTTP single route. For example, it is common to express a route as an http URI template like "/resource/{resource_id}". In systems where only equals queries are available, searching for {@code http.uri=/resource} won't match if the actual request was "/resource/abcd-ff". Historical note: This was commonly expressed as "http.uri" in zipkin, eventhough it was most often just a path.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.prefix | http. | Prefix for header names if they are added as tags.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.request-size | http.request.size | The size of the non-empty HTTP request body, in bytes. Ex. "16384" <p>Large uploads can exceed limits or contribute directly to latency.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.response-size | http.response.size | The size of the non-empty HTTP response body, in bytes. Ex. "16384" <p>Large downloads can exceed limits or contribute directly to latency.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.status-code | http.status_code | The HTTP response code, when not in 2xx range. Ex. "503" Used to filter for error status. 2xx range are not logged as success codes are less interesting for latency troubleshooting. Omitting saves at least 20 bytes per span.

|spring.sleuth.keys.http.url | http.url | The entire URL, including the scheme, host and query parameters if available. Ex. "https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/objects/abcd-ff?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256..." Combined with {@link #method}, you can understand the fully-qualified request line. This is optional as it may include private data or be of considerable length.

|spring.sleuth.keys.hystrix.command-group | commandGroup | Name of the command group. Hystrix uses the command group key to group together commands such as for reporting, alerting, dashboards, or team/library ownership. @see com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommandGroupKey

|spring.sleuth.keys.hystrix.prefix |  | Prefix for header names if they are added as tags.

|spring.sleuth.keys.hystrix.thread-pool-key | threadPoolKey | Name of the thread pool key. The thread-pool key represents a {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPool} for monitoring, metrics publishing, caching, and other such uses. A {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommand} is associated with a single {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPool} as retrieved by the {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPoolKey} injected into it, or it defaults to one created using the {@link com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixCommandGroupKey} it is created with. @see com.netflix.hystrix.HystrixThreadPoolKey

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.headers |  | Additional headers that should be added as tags if they exist. If the header value is not a String it will be converted to a String using its toString() method.

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.payload.size | message/payload-size | An estimate of the size of the payload if available.

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.payload.type | message/payload-type | The type of the payload.

|spring.sleuth.keys.message.prefix | message/ | Prefix for header names if they are added as tags.

|spring.sleuth.keys.mvc.controller-class | mvc.controller.class | The lower case, hyphen delimited name of the class that processes the request. Ex. class named "BookController" will result in "book-controller" tag value.

|spring.sleuth.keys.mvc.controller-method | mvc.controller.method | The lower case, hyphen delimited name of the class that processes the request. Ex. method named "listOfBooks" will result in "list-of-books" tag value.

|zuul.add-proxy-headers | true | Flag to determine whether the proxy adds X-Forwarded-* headers.

|zuul.force-original-query-string-encoding | false | Flag to force the original query string encoding when building the backend URI in SimpleHostRoutingFilter. When activated, query string will be built using HttpServletRequest getQueryString() method instead of UriTemplate. Note that this flag is not used in RibbonRoutingFilter with services found via DiscoveryClient (like Eureka).

|zuul.host.connect-timeout-millis | 2000 | The connection timeout in millis. Defaults to 2000.

|zuul.host.max-per-route-connections | 20 | The maximum number of connections that can be used by a single route.

|zuul.ignore-security-headers | true | Flag to say that SECURITY_HEADERS are added to ignored headers if spring security is on the classpath. By setting ignoreSecurityHeaders to false we can switch off this default behaviour. This should be used together with disabling the default spring security headers see https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/html/headers.html#default-security-headers

|zuul.ignored-headers |  | Names of HTTP headers to ignore completely (i.e. leave them out of downstream requests and drop them from downstream responses).

|zuul.ignored-patterns |  | 

|zuul.ignored-services |  | Set of service names not to consider for proxying automatically. By default all services in the discovery client will be proxied.

|zuul.sensitive-headers |  | List of sensitive headers that are not passed to downstream requests. Defaults to a "safe" set of headers that commonly contain user credentials. It's OK to remove those from the list if the downstream service is part of the same system as the proxy, so they are sharing authentication data. If using a physical URL outside your own domain, then generally it would be a bad idea to leak user credentials.

|zuul.servlet-path | /zuul | Path to install Zuul as a servlet (not part of Spring MVC). The servlet is more memory efficient for requests with large bodies, e.g. file uploads.

|zuul.set-content-length | false | Setting for SendResponseFilter to conditionally set Content-Length header.

|zuul.ssl-hostname-validation-enabled | true | Flag to say whether the hostname for ssl connections should be verified or not. Default is true. This should only be used in test setups!

|zuul.thread-pool.thread-pool-key-prefix |  | A prefix for HystrixThreadPoolKey of hystrix's thread pool that is allocated to each service Id. This property is only applicable when using THREAD as ribbonIsolationStrategy and useSeparateThreadPools = true

|zuul.thread-pool.use-separate-thread-pools | false | Flag to determine whether RibbonCommands should use separate thread pools for hystrix. By setting to true, RibbonCommands will be executed in a hystrix's thread pool that it is associated with. Each RibbonCommand will be associated with a thread pool according to its commandKey (serviceId).
